            <h1>Poster Travel Tube Ring</h1>

            <h2>Model Description</h2>
            <p>
                In my junior year of high school, I was fortunate enough to be invited to the American Junior Academy of Science's 
                annual conference, held that year in Boston, Massachusetts. There, I presented my project, SeamStress, at the American Association
                for the Advancement of Science's conference that was happening in conjunction with the junior conference I attended. 
                However, I needed a way to transport my poster without damaging it, and with just a few days before I had to leave, I didn't
                have the time to go find a travel tube.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead, I bought a mailing tube and 3d printed some rings to wrap around it.
            </p>

            <p>
                The ring can fit around the poster tube on its own, but I added zip ties for extra security. Additionally, I took a strap
                from an old lunchbox to serve as the carrying strap of the tube.
            </p>
            
            <h2>3D Printer Settings</h2>
            <p>
                Turns any 3" diameter mailing poster tube into a travel poster tube!
            </p>
            <p>
                Might need to be slightly bent open so it can fit around the tube. Adjust the position on your tube at
                your own discretion.
            </p>

                Single print. Intended to fit on a 220x220x220mm base plate.
