            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Communication is one of the most vital aspects of human life — it is how we express ourselves and build meaningful relationships 
                with one another. Yet, over half a million Americans use American Sign Language (ASL) as their primary language, and due to the 
                lack of ASL fluency, they are prevented from fully connecting with others. Existing sensor-based solutions are controversial as 
                they often use multiple bulky motion sensors that are undesirable to wear while also placed on glove apparatuses that deprive the 
                user’s sense of touch.  To mitigate these problems, this study investigated the use of acoustic sensing through piezoelectric 
                sensors to record acoustic data with an additional accelerometer to record acceleration data and classify hand gestures using 
                Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Two prototypes were made, the second of which was developed based on the results of the first prototype. 
                This study tested different sensor configurations in individual (n=1) and volunteer (n=11) trials as test subjects made 6 different 
                simple hand gestures and the 26 letters of the ASL alphabet. It was found that the most optimal sensor configuration for the first 
                prototype had strong recognition (≥60%) for 17 gestures and weak recognition (&lt60%) for 5 gestures, indicating its high recognition 
                rate for select gestures; the second prototype had a strong recognition for 7 gestures and weak recognition for 18 gestures, indicating 
                its higher versatility. SkeleSens ultimately introduces a viable alternative to sign interpretation and new applications for acoustic 
                sensing in computer control.
