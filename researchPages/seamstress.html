            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Electronic textiles (e-textiles) have shown promise across many fields, one of the most prevalent being healthcare, as they can aid in the rehabilitation 
                of musculoskeletal impairments, some of the most common disorders in the United States. This study aimed to design, build, and test an e-textile system 
                that utilized conductive thread stitched into the seams of a knee sleeve to measure the flexion of joints in the body. This was done by measuring the 
                sensor resistance as a test subject bends their knee joint to various angles. Two prototypes were developed that tested different placements of the 
                conductible seam that was used to measure the sensor resistance. A regression model for each of the prototypes was derived from the resistances, which 
                demonstrated the relationship between the angle of flexion and the resistance of the sensor. The regression model for the first prototype indicated the 
                sensor had a moderate coefficient of determination, and high precision, but low sensitivity. The regression model for the second prototype indicated the 
                sensor had a high coefficient of determination, high precision, and high sensitivity.
